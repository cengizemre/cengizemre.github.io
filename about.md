Full stack developer at Togi Teknoloji

### More Information

My journey as a software developer began in 2016, when I first started learning programming. Initially, I focused on mastering Javascript and Node.js (express.js), and later expanded my skills to include C# programming, where I gained practical experience building applications. Throughout my journey, I constantly challenged myself to overcome obstacles, researched new approaches to problem-solving, and reflected on my mistakes, all of which helped me to grow both as a developer and as a person. Along the way, I also enhanced my English language proficiency by reading technical documentation and engaging with the global developer community. I am excited to continue my journey as a lifelong learner and to make meaningful contributions to the field of software development.
